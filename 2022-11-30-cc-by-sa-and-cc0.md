Once again a small sign of life from us! This time it is about the licensing of the data. Don't worry, this won't be the thousandth blog to explain the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/). We just want to address one aspect of the "BY". If you want to reuse works that are licensed with BY, you have to name author and source. We use data licensed with cc-by-sa-4.0, so of course we name the author, which is the person who created the data, who transcribed the words, who translated the sentences, and we name the source, which is the basis for the particular ORAEC text.

Look at any page. After the metadata and the bibliography comes the credits item. There you will find the author and source information.

Why do we bother you with these self-evident facts? Well, in our [last blog post](https://oraec.github.io/2022/11/23/two-trivia.html) we reported that we added the hierarchical paths to the metadata. However, these paths are not in [AED](https://simondschweitzer.github.io/aed/) (which is the source we used to generate the metadata), but only in the partial extract, which in turn is the source for AED. So far we have not had the [partial extract](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:b4-opus4-29190) in the credits, but by adding the paths this source must necessarily be named. This is a fat mistake that we omitted this last week! Sorry [BBAW](https://www.bbaw.de/), which has published the partial excerpt on its [edoc server](https://edoc.bbaw.de/home). Fortunately, nothing changes in the author citation. If you look now, you will see that we have improved the source citation.

We also draw the following consequence from our mistake: Since it is easy to forget additional sources or authors, we will put our own things we create in the future under the cc0 license. Look for the notice at the beginning and end of this blog! Then we can easily add that cc0 data to the existing data that is licensed with cc-by-sa-4.0 without having to pay attention to the credits. And then everyone can use our newly created data without falling into the attribution trap we fell into.

So, now we continue with the linking between OREAC and [Trismegistos](https://www.trismegistos.org/). We have already (internally) linked more than 1000 texts to Trismegistos. Let's see how many there will be in total.
