# ORAEC and STaTbS21D

So, this blog is about a collaboration again. Do you know the project [STaTbS21D](https://statbs21d.github.io/)? The goal of the project is a "Synoptic Edition of Book of the Dead Spell Sources from the 21st Dynasty". Many different papyri and other sources transmit the Book of the Dead, which consists of different spells. The sources are quite different: the order of the spells can be different. There are also differences between sources within spells. A synoptic edition is a very helpful tool, because you can clearly find the different sources for a spell and compare them. The project STaTbS21D takes care of the spells of the 21st dynasty. Have a look at the website <https://statbs21d.github.io/>. There you can get detailed information about this project. Or have a look at the following, less than 10 minutes long Youtube video, which presents the project in a very understandable way:

We like the project very much and wish it all the best and a rich harvest! Besides the wish, we have other things to report:

The project publishes the spells in both MdC and Unicode. Hooray for that! Check it out here: <https://statbs21d.github.io/spells.html>. STaTbS21D follows [our recommendations for Unicode](https://oraec.github.io/2022/09/28/recommendations-encoding-hieroglyphs.html). Hooray again! They have developed their own tool to convert MdC to Unicode: <https://statbs21d.github.io/mdc2unicode.html>. This tool has the advantage over [our service](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/mdc_to_unicode_converter.html) that you can convert individual files. The tool takes your gly files and creates files with Unicode hieroglyphs. You must bookmark this!

The spells published by the project can be found in a Github repository and are freely licensed. We reuse them by referencing the data for our hieroglyphic metasearch engine. <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html> now has STaTbS21D as another project along with JSesh, ORAEC, PNM, Rams√®s, TLA, and Wikisource. This means that our search engine automatically searches 7 different Egyptological projects for hieroglyphic spellings. Cool, isn't it?

If you want your project to be part of our metasearch engine, write us!
