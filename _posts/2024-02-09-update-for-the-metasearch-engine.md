# Update for the Metasearch Engine, a Correction and two Announcements

A blog again after a long time! But, dear readers, before you get too excited, it's just a very short blog with three small topics and an outlook.

## Update for the Metasearch Engine

Erhart Graefe has updated the [Prosopographia Aegypti](https://www1.ivv1.uni-muenster.de/prosoaeg/index.html) and provided us with the new data. Many thanks to Erhart Graefe! The updated data are now available in our metasearch engines: <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphic_word_forms.html> and <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html>. Have fun searching.

## Correction

Serge Rosmorduc pointed out an error in a [previous blog](https://oraec.github.io/2023/05/10/metasearch-engine-for-egyptian-hieroglyphs.html). We wrote there:

> It is always a bit annoying when you want to search for characters in JSesh. You have to search twice, once for m and once for G17. In our search one query is enough, more about that below.

However, the [JSesh software](https://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org/) finds these cases regardless of whether they are coded with m or G17. Only one search is needed. So the problem does not exist if you use this software. However, it does occur if you only have the files with the codes, e.g. the files in the [JSesh repository](https://github.com/rosmord/MDC-texts). A normal text editor will not find an m if you search for G17. Dear readers, if you take another look at the earlier blog, change "It is always a bit annoying when you want to search for characters in JSesh." to "It is always a bit annoying when you want to search for characters in JSesh files with a text editor." Dear Serge Rosmorduc, thank you for your comment! If anyone finds other bugs, please let us know.

## Two Announcements

Finally, two announcements that have recently flown into our inbox.

### Machine Learning for Ancient Languages

This is a workshop within the [62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics](https://2024.aclweb.org/). Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Check out the [workshop website](https://www.ml4al.com/)!

### Networks in Ancient Near Eastern Studies

This is a [call for papers](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/ancient-near-eastern-empires/news/call-for-papers-networks-in-the-ancient-near-east) for an open access volume. Egyptology is not actually part of Ancient Near Eastern Studies, but an organizer posted this call on Twitter (sorry: X) with the hashtag #Egyptology:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Do you use networks or network analysis in research about the ancient Near East?

### Lent

Lent is starting soon. We will of course be focusing on other things and taking a digital break, just like last year. We'll be back in touch after Easter. We've been working hard on bigger things in the background, but they're not finished yet. Until then!
