# Best Practice Projects: STaTbS21D

Digital projects always start with a lot of commitment. They have a vision that they are trying to realize. But is it possible to reconcile the vision with the mundane day-to-day work that every project requires? Many projects create a statement of intent, but then deliver nothing. Many projects fall asleep. Some reach a certain level of completion, but it is questionable whether they can adapt their product to the ever-changing technical conditions. We are all familiar with Egyptological examples of the stages described here. The reasons are many. In our opinion, projects can be supported from the outside in two ways. If it is an open project, you can collaborate. This is easier in the digital environment than it used to be. Many open source projects have a community behind them. The second way is praise! You can show that the project is valuable to users, which will hopefully motivate the project's contributors. That's what we want to do in this little blog today.

[Six months ago](https://oraec.github.io/2023/11/01/oraec-and-statbs21d.html) we mentioned the [STaTbS21D project](https://statbs21d.github.io/), which aims to produce a "Synoptic Edition of Book of the Dead Spell Sources from the 21st Dynasty". A lot has happened since then: more than 20 new texts have been [published](https://github.com/STaTbS21D/Book_of_the_Dead_Sources/tree/main). The number of authors has increased from one (Ivan Rodríguez López) to three (Naglaa Ezzeldeen, Thiago Ribeiro, Ivan Rodríguez López). Many congratulations! We are glad that your project is alive and active. To make STaTbS21D even more visible, we have integrated the new texts into our [hieroglyphic meta search engine](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html). Keep up the good work!

Dear readers, if you are planning a digital project yourself, we recommend that you get inspired by successful examples. Take a look at what has been done there and imitate the right decisions! Don't be discouraged if there are only a few of you, or even if you are alone and have little time. With a well-thought-out goal and good organization, a lot can be achieved, as STaTbS21D proves.
