# ORAEC and Osiris Spelling Software

There are so many treasures on the internet that you don't know about or overlook, but that deserve your attention. So today we would like to recommend the [Osiris Spelling Software](https://osirisspellingsoftware.000webhostapp.com/src/index.html) to your link list.

The Coffin Texts are a rich source for the religious world of the Middle Kingdom, in which the god Osiris plays a prominent role. The mentioned software lists the different spellings of the god's name: 𓁹𓊨, 𓊨𓁹, 𓁹𓀭, 𓊨𓀭 ... You can search for individual spellings and filter the search by various criteria. The hits return the spelling with bibliographic reference, context, spell number, document, position, time, and place. Here is a screenshot so you can see what the hit list looks like:

So, if you are interested in spellings of gods or Osiris in the Middle Kingdom, then use this tool to open up the Coffin Texts! Big kudos to [César Guerra Méndez](https://github.com/csrgrr), who developed the software. So that you don't forget this great website, we have included it in our [metasearch engine](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/). So if you search for [hieroglyphs](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html) or [hieroglyphic word forms](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphic_word_forms.html) there and enter a spelling like 𓄹𓏤𓂋𓀭, you will be offered a link to the Osiris Spelling Software.

We have also added the Osiris spellings to [our tool that automatically converts hieroglyphs into transliteration](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/hiero_to_transliteration.html). Don't forget, if you discover any missing spellings, let us know [here](https://github.com/oraec/corpus/issues/new?assignees=oraec&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=add-a-new-hieroglyphs-transliteration-pair.md&title=%5BNEW+PAIR%5D) so that we can improve our tool.
