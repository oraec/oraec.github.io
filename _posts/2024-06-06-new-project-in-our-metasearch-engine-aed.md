# New project in our metasearch engine: AED

Hey guys! Just a quick note this time! You know the [AED](https://simondschweitzer.github.io/aed/index.html), right? It's a digital dictionary that gives you not only transliteration and translation, but also other information. It tells you not only how to translate a word, but also the temporal and spatial distribution of its occurrences. There is also an overview of how a word is spelled. The spellings are sorted by frequency. Cool, isn't it? You can search for these spellings in an [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aed_ancientegyptiandictionary). Dear iPhone owners, we have now integrated the spellings from the AED into our metasearch engine for you (and everyone else). Have a look [here](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphic_word_forms.html) and [here](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/search/search_hieroglyphs.html).
