# Unicode Recommendations Checker

If you read our blog, you know that Unicode, or more precisely the representation of hieroglyphs in Unicode, is a big topic for us. That's why we're happy to see more and more tools that create Unicode hieroglyphs. Recently the following repo was published: [gly2mdc2](https://github.com/MaReTEgyptologists/gly2mdc2). This allows you to convert your gly files to Unicode. We have a simple web service online that converts MdC to Unicode: <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/mdc_to_unicode_converter.html> Our collaboration project [STaTbS21D](https://statbs21d.github.io/) has its own [converter](https://statbs21d.github.io/mdc2unicode.html) that converts gly files to Unicode. Highly recommended!

And if you really read our blog, you know that we refer to [our recommendations](https://oraec.github.io/2022/09/28/recommendations-encoding-hieroglyphs.html) in every blog. Unfortunately, some of the codepoints available in Unicode do not reflect characters, but are pure variants. Our recommendations show which codepoints are safe to use and which ones should be avoided. These recommendations are taken into account both in our web service and in the converter of the STaTbS21D project. However, in the case of other texts with Unicode hieroglyphs, it is impossible to know whether they comply with our recommendations or not.

We have therefore created a [Unicode Recommendations Checker](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/urc.html): <https://oraec.github.io/corpus/urc.html>. This tool checks whether the Unicode hieroglyphs are real characters or just variants. For such non-recommended codepoints, the tool offers encoding with the correct character. It also outputs the entire text according to the guidelines. 𓅁 is preset as an example. If you now press the "Check!" button, the result of the check will look like this "𓅁 should be 𓌳𓄿". In addition, the whole text is transformed according to the guidelines. The result is 𓌳𓄿.

Have fun checking!
