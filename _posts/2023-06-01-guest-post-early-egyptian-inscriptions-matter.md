# Guest post: Early Egyptian inscriptions matter or why is the phonetic value of ìçã mr

A slightly different blog this time. We're going to give the floor to Drea, our expert of the Early Dynastic Period. Please, Drea, go ahead!

Hello dear readers! My name is Drea Fante and I'm a big fan of Early Dynastic Egypt because it's just so exciting to watch Egyptian culture develop. You get to see it grow. The inscriptions are very appealing to me. So I'm very happy that there are so many tools available to study them:

## Important tools for the study of early inscriptions

Each inscription has its own ID that you can quote. The numbering system inspired us to introduce the ORAEC numbers. The inventor of the IDs of the Early Dynastic inscriptions is Jochem Kahl, who used them to organize the Early Dynastic inscriptions as a "source list" for his [dissertation](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/10402) by sorting the inscriptions chronologically and assigning them a sequential number. Ilona Regulski has integrated and continued the system in her [database](https://www1.ivv1.uni-muenster.de/litw3/Aegyptologie/index06.htm) of Early Dynastic inscriptions. Finally, Gunnar Sperveslage has presented a [monograph](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/122784) which adopts the numbering system of Kahl and Regulski and introduces new IDs for other, additional inscriptions. Jochem Kahl writes about the "source list" in his dissertation on page 13 in footnote 17:

> In der Hoffnung, da√ü dieser Anhang auch f√ºr zuk√ºnftige Forschungen auf dem Gebiet der 0.-3. Dynastie eine Grundlage bilden kann.

So this hope has been fully confirmed!

What is this dissertation mentioned about? Well, Kahl describes there the rules of the Egyptian writing system. But the main part of the book is the huge sign list of all hieroglyphs of the Early Dynastic Period!

Jochem Kahl is involved in two other major tools for the study of the inscriptions of the Early Dynastic Period. In 1995 he presented together with Nicole Kloth and Ursula Zimmermann a [collection](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/11672) of all inscriptions of the 3rd Dynasty. On the left is an illustration of the text, on the right the transcription and translation. Detailed indexes complete this excellent resource. In addition, since 2002 he has published a [dictionary](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/30005) of early Egyptian language. Unfortunately, nothing has been published since 2004. So you can only look up words up to the initial letter ·∫ñ. But up to that point the work is simply brilliant. Dates of occurrences, writings and facsimiles of sources. Fantastic! Moreover, even the vocabulary of personal names is made accessible. For example, on page 291 there is the entry ·∏•jp, "hurry, run," with the occurrence in the personal name ·∏§jp-kÍú£=j. We will see below why I emphasize this.

Speaking of personal names: There is no separate work on early personal names, nor on titles. However, one can consult the books that deal primarily with the Old Kingdom: Scheele-Schweitzer's [work](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/51388) on personal names also considers those of the 3rd dynasty, and [Jones](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/17063) also lists titles of the Early Dynastic Period.

Finally, there is a wonderful [palaeography](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/61917) by Ilona Regulski which gives the epigraphic range of all signs.

Let us summarize the cited works here, quasi as an introduction for all those who are interested:

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list (yes, yes, the works of Kaplony, Morenz or Wilkinson are also important, of course), but it should serve as an introduction to the subject for those who are interested. Secondly, these works should be consulted when dealing with inscriptions of the Early Dynastic Period. For lexical questions, Kahl's dictionary should be consulted. To research personal names without evaluating the work of Scheele-Schweitzer is negligent. People, refer to these works. If you do not, your conclusions are open to attack. We will see that below!

And the research continues. Recently, a [volume](https://www.ibaes.de/ibaes26/index.html) in the [IBAES](https://www.ibaes.de/) series has appeared, in which two articles are relevant to us. Gunnar Sperveslage presents a project to digitally record inscriptions in the essay [Methodische und technische √úberlegungen zur digitalen Erfassung der Fr√ºhzeitinschriften](https://www.ibaes.de/ibaes26/inhalt.html). The new [TLA](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de) already contains this data! I'll link to it below for the blog! In addition, this project is also working on the Early Period sign inventory, as described in the second [article](https://www.ibaes.de/ibaes26/inhalt.html). We can look forward to the results of this project.

Okay, so what is this about? Well, this blog was born out of anger about an article that tries to explain away the results of the Early Dynastic inscriptions by using a highly impure manner. My goal in this blog is to emphasize the relevance of the Early Dynastic inscriptions for general questions in Egyptology. The study of the Early Dynastic Period produces solid results that cannot be swept aside so easily. This is by no means a second division of Egyptology. And finally: It is more than wrong to consider the findings of the Early Dynastic Period on the basis of circumstances that took place more than two thousand years later, without taking seriously valid internal, i.e. contemporary, explanations. I am the defensor saeculi antiqui here.

## General remarks

The article is Quack, Joachim Friedrich: ["Nochmals zum Lautwert von Gardiner Sign-List U 23"](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/128767), published in the current issue of LingAeg. This article has some history. Already in 2003, Quack published a [paper](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/37505) dealing with the phonetic value of ìçã. Based on certain spellings from the first millennium and a pun from the Pyramid Texts, he postulated the reading m·∏•r for ìçã. This approach was later contradicted: Ilona Regulski cited two inscriptions from the Early Dynastic Period in which a ìå∏ functions as a complement for ìçã, cf. [Regulski, A Palaeographic Study of Early Writing in Egypt. 2010](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/61917), p. 196. [Simon Schweitzer, Zum Lautwert einiger Hieroglyphen. In: Z√ÑS 138, 2011, pp. 142-144](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/82632) mentions two other inscriptions from the Early Dynastic Period that also confirm the phonetic value mr. This new paper by Quack again compiles his evidence for m·∏•r and attempts to refute the circumstantial evidence from the Early Dynastic Period. Thus, we have here the following sequence: 1) an assertion by Quack 2) a critical examination of his thesis by other Egyptologists 3) Quack attempts to support his original thesis and refute the objections. Such a sequence is found several times in Quack's ≈ìuvre: Quack's view on embalming and the court of the dead in the Insinger papyrus ([Balsamierung und Totengericht im Papyrus Insinger. In: Enchoria 25, 1999, pp. 27-38](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/15923)) has been contradicted by Stadler ([War eine dramatische Auff√ºhrung eines Totengerichts Teil der √§gyptischen Totenriten? In: SAK 29, 2001, pp. 331-348](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/18044) & [Zwei Bemerkungen zum Papyrus Insinger. In: Z√ÑS 130, 2003, pp. 186-196](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/37072)) and Smith ([Traversing Eternity. 2009](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/51249), pp. 26-27). Quack's replication of this is [Nochmals zu Balsamierung und Totengericht im gro√üen demotischen Weisheitsbuch. In: Enchoria 34, 2014/2015, pp. 105-118](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/106854). Quack claims in [Gibt es einen stammhaften Imperativ ÍûΩyiÃØ im Mittel√§gyptischen? In: LingAeg 12, 2004, pp. 133-136](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/39759) that there is no stem imperative of jyiÃØ. Schweitzer ([Nochmals zum stammhaften Imperativ von jy·ªâÃ≠/jw·ªâÃ≠. In: LingAeg 16, 2008, pp. 319-321](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/50545)) and others have listed some examples of a stemmed imperative. It is this evidence that Quack, [Nochmals zum angeblichen stammhaften Imperativ \*\*iyi 'komm!'. In: LingAeg 24, 2017, pp. 101-110](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/110788) attempts to refute. So this is not the first time that Quack cannot convince Egyptologists with his first article, but has to publish a second one. It will be interesting to see how Quack will react to the article [Smith, New Perspectives on the Book of Thoth. In: OLZ 117, 2022, pp. 271-296](https://doi.org/10.1515/olzg-2022-0093), which criticizes Quack in a very substantial way.

Before I get to the content, a few words about the form. Quack is always very apodictic when it comes to judging the opinion of other Egyptologists when they do not follow his opinion: "Die Polemik von Tak√°cs (2008: 362 und 366) mi√üversteht nicht nur Details meiner Argumentation, sondern ermangelt vor allem jedes Erkl√§rungsmodells f√ºr die unbestreitbar vorhandenen Schreibungen mit Einkonsonantenzeichen *·∏•* und *h* f√ºr in anderen F√§llen mit dem Schriftzeichen ìçã geschriebene W√∂rter. Eine eigene Auseinandersetzung mit ihr scheint mir deshalb unn√∂tig." (p. 271, fn. 5) "Vgl. auch Noonan (2019: 102f.), der die neuere Diskussion um den Lautwert des Kopf-Zeichens nicht wahrgenommen hat und mit m√§√üigen Argumenten versucht, die bei der traditionellen Lesung bestehende Irregularit√§t der Vertretung von √§gyptischen *t* durch hebr√§isches *·π≠* herunterzuspielen." (p. 274, fn. 20) "S. auch Breyer (2019: 117f.), der ebenso gerade den wichtigen Punkt nicht sieht, da√ü die Lesung der Kopf-Hieroglyphe als *tp* oder *·π≠p* noch zur Diskussion steht [...]." (p. 274, fn. 20) There is nothing to be said against direct language, such as Quack uses, if he supports his judgments by clean argumentation. But it is precisely clean argumentation that is lacking in this article. Facts are not treated in their entirety. Rather, aspects that do not support his thesis are omitted. The work is abbreviated and thus unclean. We will see this again and again in the course of this text. Here is just one example as an introduction, which has nothing to do with the question of the phonetic value of ìçã. Simon Schweitzer, in his article on the phonetic value of ìçã, had also dealt with the phonetic value of ìÅ∂. He concludes that one must stick to the traditional reading tp. Folks, whether you read tp or dp, the issue now is argumentation. If words that spell ìÅ∂ have survived in other writing systems, one could deduce how to read ìÅ∂. Schweitzer (p. 134) writes:

> Die Verbindung[fn. 24] zwischen dem neuassyrischen Traumdeuter *·∏•ar·π≠ibi* [sic!] und ìÅ∑ìÇãìè≠ìÅ∂ìè§ìÄÄ, ‚ÄûOberhaupt‚Äú[fn. 25] ist wohl kaum aufrecht zu erhalten, da sich die jeweilige Bedeutung stark unterscheidet[fn. 26]. Das im Alten Testament erscheinende *·∏•ar·π≠ummim*, das seit Stricker[fn. 27] gerne als Wiedergabe von ìÅ∑ìÇãìè≠ìÅ∂ìè§ìÄÄ, ‚ÄûOberhaupt‚Äú gesehen wird, listet Werning als Beleg f√ºr den Ansatz von *d* auf[fn. 28]. Jedoch ist diese Gleichung mit Lambdin[fn. 29] aus phonologischen Gr√ºnden und mit Goedicke[fn. 30] aus semantischen Gr√ºnden abzulehnen.

Thus, according to Schweitzer, there are semantic reasons and, in the case of ·∏•ar·π≠ummim, additional phonological reasons against an equation.

Quack also discusses representation in foreign languages. He writes:

> Da dieser Punkt f√ºr die Lesung von ìçã keine zentrale Rolle spielt, erspare ich mir eine Detaildiskussion, obgleich kritisch gesagt werden mu√ü, da√ü Schweitzer bei der Diskussion √ºber die Lesung der Kopfhieroglyphe zu Unrecht die eklatant richtige Entscheidung von akkadisch *·∏´ar·π≠ibi* und hebr√§isch *·∏•ar·π≠ummim* (Plural) zu √§gyptisch ·∏•rÍûΩ-·π≠p verwirft,[fn. 20]

Footnote 20 states:

> Schweitzer (2011: 134). Die Behauptung, die Worte pa√üten semantisch nicht zusammen, ist definitiv nicht zutreffend, wie die Rolle eben des ·∏•rÍûΩ-·π≠p als Magier und Ritualspezialist in der demotischen Literatur (einschlie√ülich des hieratisch geschriebenen pVandier) deutlich zeigt, s. Holm (2013: 104-114); Escolano-Poveda (2020: 243f.); Quack (iDr.). [...]

Whether the words fit together semantically or not is not important to us. We are only interested in how Quack argues. In the text he writes that the equation is wrongly rejected. But the footnote proves this only for semantics. Quack says nothing about phonology. But phonology was Schweitzer's central point, along with semantics, for rejecting the equation. So the footnote only gives the appearance of a complete refutation of Schweitzer. But without the treatment of phonology, this is not possible at all. So the footnote is just a sloppy trick to support the claim "da√ü Schweitzer bei der Diskussion √ºber die Lesung der Kopfhieroglyphe zu Unrecht die eklatant richtige Entscheidung von akkadisch *·∏´ar·π≠ibi* und hebr√§isch *·∏•ar·π≠ummim* (Plural) zu √§gyptisch ·∏•rÍûΩ-·π≠p verwirft." Crucial facts are simply omitted from the argument when the desired result requires it. The consideration is selective. This impurity is not an isolated case, as we shall see! One has to look at every quoted discussion in the original, because one cannot know whether the one in Quack's presentation is distorted.

## ìçã in Early Dynastic inscriptions

Now to the content: I will discuss the four occurrences from the Early Dynastic inscriptions and prove that they all support the phonetic value mr. In addition, I will list other evidence from the Early Dynastic inscriptions.

### Title ìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå°

Lacau and Lauer ([Lacau, Lauer, La pyramide √† degr√©s IV.1. Inscriptions grav√©es sur les vases. 1959, pl. 22.121 & pl. 22.122](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/24635)) published in 1959 two vessels from the 2nd dynasty which both carry a column with an inscription. These are the inscriptions with IDs 2140 and 2141, and the images are online at <https://archive.org/details/LacauLauer1959/page/n55>. The title ·∏•m-n·πØr-Spd.w is followed by a ìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå°, where Lacau and Lauer were only able to identify the first two characters as the title. [Kaplony, Eine Schminkpalette von K√∂nig Skorpion aus Abu 'Um√ªri. In: Or 34, 1965](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/4706), pp. 139-140, fn. 1, recognized that it was smr-wÍú•.tj. All other scholars have followed his view, cf. Kahl, W√∂rterbuch, p. 109; Kahl, System, p. 740, fn. 2341. Sperveslage transcribes and translates the beginning of the inscription as follows:

> ìáÆìÖèìäπìçõìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå°ìàñìâêìàñìÇì <br />
> ·∏•m-n·πØr-Spd.w smr-wÍú•.tj N(.j)-PriÃØ-n(=j)-kÍú£(=j) <br />
> Priester des Sopdu, Einziger Freund, Ni-per-ni-kai <br />
> <https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICEASEXYKBLjoUFFjJHo90aiTwk> & <https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/GO7IM5SWTFGGZMICT5NDUUB4BI>

The complementation with ìå∏ is unusual. Regulski justifies convincingly:

> Two hard stone vessels from Saqqara (2140-41), probably dating to the Second Dynasty, render the title ≈õmr wÍú•.ty in ·∏•m n·πØr ≈öpd.w ≈õmr wÍú•.ty "prophet of Sopdu, sole friend", followed by a personal name and a place name. [fn. 2069] The orthography of ≈õmr is highly unusual but particularly interesting in this respect. The phonetic value mr is represented twice; by ìçã (U23) to the left of the central placed ìã¥ (S29), and by ìå∏ (U6) to its right side. The reason why is obvious; to avoid confusion with other scepter-signs (S42, T3, and V24), which all looked alike in the Early Dynastic period (p. 185). By adding an ideogram with the same phonetic value[fn. 2070], such misunderstanding was avoided.

The two inscriptions are a central witness for the reading of ìçã as mr. Quack, so if he is to maintain his reading m·∏•r, he must invalidate these passages. He has four objections:
1. It is not certain that ìå∏ really belongs to the title. Lacau and Lauer have not yet assigned ìå∏ to the smr title.
2. Palaeographically, it is not certain whether the flat sign after ìå∏ is really to be understood as a harpoon with the phonetic value wÍú• and whether ìçã is really to be read.
3. The interpretation of the personal name is uncertain.
4. The position of ìã¥ after ìçã is singular.

In detail:

#### First objection

This is a very weak argument. It would mean that knowledge can only be considered certain if the editio princeps lists it. Should we doubt all the progress that Quack made in reading the Book of Thoth just because Zauzich and Jasnow read differently? Obviously, there is a title at the beginning of the inscription, so one might expect a sequence of titles and personal names. Regulski explains, as quoted above, why the ìå∏ is here. If the ìå∏ did not belong the smr, there would be no way to read the inscription. What title beginning with ìå∏ should follow the smr? Quack offers no alternative. But that would be necessary to shake Regulski's plausible explanation. It is also inexplicable that Quack does not mention Regulski's argument in his discussion of these two inscriptions. He simply omits it. This unclean selective argumentation of Quack is only understandable if he sees no possibility to invalidate Regulski's explanation of the ìå∏.

#### Second objection

The flat sign after ìå∏ is - according to Kahl, System, pp. 741-742 - a t1, which represents a "einzackige Harpune". Contrary to Quack's assertion, the shape of the hook is not at all unusual, as can be seen in Regulski, pp. 648-649. Quack erroneously refers to page 628. Whether the forms present there led him to this untenable statement?
The tall narrow sign before ìã¥ could indeed be confused with other scepter signs. Therefore the complementation with ìå∏ makes sense. This is where Quack really should have addressed Regulski's argument.
By the way, the complementation with ìå∏ is not singular, see below.

#### Third objection

The form of inscription is a sequence of titles followed by a personal name. Even if the interpretation of the personal name is problematic, this does not affect the titles. Of course, a N.j + X is unusual, since X is a personal name and not the name of a god or king. But such a name pattern is attested in the Old Kingdom, cf. N.j-Íú¢bbj <https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/lemma/850877> Probably there will be more cases from the 3rd millennium, but they cannot always be recognized because of the possible defective writing of nisba n.j (on this Scheele-Schweitzer, Personennamen, p. 151).

#### Fourth objection

Quack wonders about the sequence ìçãìã¥ and thinks that it is singular. This is completely unfounded. Here some examples of different words from the Early Dynastic inscriptions, where exactly this sequence ìçãìã¥ is documented.

Nowadays it is quite easy to find such spellings. Our [metasearch engine for hieroglyphs](https://oraec.github.io/2023/05/10/metasearch-engine-for-egyptian-hieroglyphs.html) provides the results. But even earlier it was easy to find them with [Regulski's database](https://www1.ivv1.uni-muenster.de/litw3/Aegyptologie/index06.htm).

#### Conclusion

Let's summarize: The sequence ìçãìã¥ is well attested. The palaeographic evidence supports the reading of the flat sign as wÍú•. There is a title sequence that can only be understood if ìå∏ is the complement of ìçã. With a phonetic value m·∏•r, this inscription cannot be read. Instead, there is clear evidence for the phonetic value mr.

### Personal name ìÖ≠ìàòìéõìçã

[Quibell, Archaic Mastabas. 1923](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/44951), p. 38 published the following inscription (which today has ID 3334) on a vessel more than a hundred years ago: ìÖ≠ìàòìéõìçã. Unfortunately, there is no facsimile and no photo. However, the publication is online: <https://archive.org/details/excavationsatsaq06quibuoft/page/38/mode/2up>. Kahl, Kloth and Zimmermann, pp. 180-181 published this inscription in their collection of inscriptions of the 3rd Dynasty. They understood this inscription as a personal name and read Mr-·∏§jp.w (?). This interpretation is followed by [Sperveslage](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICAAA85ltl1GVEEAneCBUlQ0APE) and Scheele-Schweitzer, #1274, who translates "Geliebter/Kanal des Hapi (?)". ìÖ≠ and ìéõ belong to the name of the god according to this understanding, and the signs ìàò and ìçã belong to mr. Quack doubts this interpretation. He lists the following objections:
1. The question marks prove that the reading is very uncertain.
2. The translation "Kanal des Apis" is to be excluded. Quack claims: "so hei√üt kein Mensch".
3. MriÃØ is not written with ìàò alone. Normally ìå∏ is used. When ìàò is used, it is only in conjunction with ìå∏.

#### First and second objection

Indeed, the facts here are not as clear as at ìáÆìÖèìäπìçõìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå°ìàñìâêìàñìÇì. Also Quack is to be agreed that a name "channel of Apis" does not correspond to the usual onomastic practice. However, a "Beloved of Apis" is perfectly consistent with onomastic practice.

#### Third objection

ìàò alone is very well attested in the inscriptions, contrary to Quack's assertion:

| Word | Inscription |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Mr.y-·∏§r.w | [0971](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICAAF532W7OR0kxWoYRrWirO0Tw) |

| Mr.t-kÍú£ | [0699](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICAAFwuyRPdOMEcBr8v2mAP4d4I); [1287](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICAAFUYuTQeU60LAp7QwL1suM3M) |

| MriÃØ-nb.wj | 1127; [1128](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/K47Y5YWXR5HPRHEENAROHI77AQ) |

There is nothing wrong with a personal name expressing the element with ìàò. Above, in the title ìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå°, ìçã appears together with ìå∏. For another proof of the combination of ìçã with ìå∏, see below. In this respect, the combination of ìçã with ìàò can very well be understood as mr.

### Personal name ìè¥ìçãìÅê

The inscription with ID 0689 is an Early Egyptian stela with the following inscription ìè¥ìçãìÅê. This is generally considered to be a spelling of the frequent personal name Mr.t-Nj.t (see the overview of personal names in the first volume of the monumental work [Kaplony, Die Inschriften der √Ñgyptischen Fr√ºhzeit. 1963](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/43367), hereafter: I√ÑF, here the entry on Mr.t-Nj.t: pp. 493-496): I√ÑF I, p. 184 and p. 494; [Klasens, Een grafsteen uit de eerste dynastie. In: OMRO 37, 1956](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/22739), p. 18, #40 and p. 22, #40; [Sperveslage](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICAAEGxJMtGCBkiChbCjYzaol8U); Kahl, System, p. 750. [Martin, Umm el-Qaab VII. Private Stelae of the Early Dynastic Period from the Royal Cemetery at Abydos. 2011](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/13467), p. 50, however, reads S·∏´m-Nj.t. This is palaeographically conceivable, even though the sign in Regulski's palaeographic plates fits the examples of U23 rather than S42. No further evidence for the name S·∏´m-Nj.t is known, but the formation type S·∏´m + name of god is attested, cf. Kahl, System, p. 707, Scheele-Schweitzer, # 3207-3209. Thus, the reading S·∏´m-Nj.t cannot be completely ruled out, but a Mr.t-Nj.t is clearly more probable on the basis of the evidence and the palaeography. [P√§tznick, Ab Hor, le "D√©sir√© d'Horus", et le poisson silure √©lectrique tachet√©. In: Apprivoiser le sauvage / Taming the Wild. 2015](http://www.enim-egyptologie.fr/?page=cenim&n=11), p. 287 reads this name Íú¢b-Nj.t. Quack follows him and translates: "die Ersehnte der Neith". He rightly objects that this name "zwar sonst unbelegt ist" (p. 282). Furthermore, even the formation type Íú¢b/Íú¢b.t + name of the gods is completely unattested, as a look at the overview in Kaplony and a look at the standard works [Ranke](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/19599) and Scheele-Schweitzer proves. Kahl's dictionary, which also breaks down the components of personal names, does not mention any verb Íú£b. Only Íú£bw "panther" is attested in personal names, cf. Kahl, System, p. 750. Why does Quack not consult Kahl's works here? Is it because Kahl knows no Íú£b, so that Quack's argumentation is weakened? Why does Quack not write how unlikely the reading Íú¢b-Nj.t is, because there is no such formation pattern? Instead, he discusses whether Nj.t or ·∏§mws.t should be read. This is not relevant to the reading of ìçã; for whether it is Mr.t-Nj.t or Mr.t-·∏§mws.t: it remains with a proof for the reading mr.

### Conclusion on Regulski's and Schweitzer's evidence

We hold: A re-examination of the Early Dynastic cases mentioned by Regulski and Schweitzer supports the phonetic value mr. Quack's attempts to invalidate the evidence have all failed.

### Further evidence

In addition, there are four other indications that support a phonetic value mr in the Early Dynastic Period:
1. The king's name Narmer is mostly written with a fish sign and ìçã. Usually both signs are also arranged in a serekh. Sometimes, however, only the fish is inside the serekh, while the ìçã is outside, e.g. [0089](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICACCTUQvOwEk0flu5MiOg9HWQU). [Petrie, Tarkhan II. 1914](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/65384), pl. 20.2 published an inscription (ID: 0109) from Tarkhan more than 100 years ago in which a sign resembling a hoe (and not the ìçã) is outside the serekh. Petrie interpreted the sign as ìå∏. His conclusions about the reading are not relevant here. If one follows Petrie, one would have here a spelling of the king's name Narmer with the hoe instead of the ìçã. [Kaiser, Einige Bemerkungen zur √§gyptischen Fr√ºhzeit. III. Die Reichseinigung. In: Z√ÑS 91, 1964](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/26714), p. 93, fn. 3, doubted the reading mr. He recognized in the sign outside the serech a ≈°nÍú•. [Gilroy, 'Forgotten' Serekhs in the Royal Ontario Museum. In: GM 180, 2001, pp. 67-76](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/16511), who published an inscription quite similar to the one from Tarkhan, followed Kaiser's interpretation. However, two reasons argue against the identification as ≈°nÍú•. First, ≈°nÍú• is understood as a storehouse. However, other inscriptions from Narmer describing administrative units formed with the king's name are not known. Only once is a [plantation](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/lemma/883157) attested with early kings: [4015](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICEAiFLiedfV8EIbrXHpXWREPwM). Second, palaeographically, the ≈°nÍú•-sign looks quite different in Early Dynastic inscriptions, as the evidence in Regulski, p. 655 clearly shows. The mr hoe, on the other hand, resembles this sign under the serekh, even though one stroke is very long. This may be due to the fact that the sign is thus adapted to the width of the serekh. Thus, Kaiser's suggestion to read ≈°nÍú• here no longer seems plausible. Rather, one must recognize the mr hoe here. This provides new evidence for the interchangeability of ìçã and ìå∏.
2. Kaplony lists a Mr-n·πØr in his compilation of early personal names (I√ÑF I, p. 497). This name has several occurrences and is written ìçãìÇãìäπ. Kahl follows Kaplony's reading, albeit with a question mark: Kahl, System, p. 750. The meaning of the name is "beloved of the god." This name also appears in the Old Kingdom, cf. Scheele-Schweitzer, #1317. The database [AG√âA](https://www.ifao.egnet.net/bases/agea/noms/), which collects names of the Old Kingdom and lists 1772 entries so far (Scheele-Schweitzer has a total of 3893 entries in her book, more than twice as many!), understands the early name as [Íú£b-n·πØr](https://www.ifao.egnet.net/bases/agea/noms/?id=13) and translates "Celui qui a √©t√© d√©sir√© par le dieu." It is curious that Kaplony's discussion is not received and that the dating to the 2nd Dynasty made by [Helck, Die Datierung der Gef√§ssaufschriften aus der Djoserpyramide. In: Z√ÑS 106, 1979, pp. 120-132](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/54203) is not taken into account. Since - as noted above - the verb Íú£b is not attested at all in the Early Dynastic Period, this reading is not probable.
3. [Am√©lineau, Les nouvelles fouilles d'Abydos 1895-1896. 1899](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/46013) published an inscription with the name of King Semerkhet, which Gauthier included in his [Livre des Rois](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/63367), I, p. 12: <https://archive.org/details/MIFAO17/page/n19>. It is number 33 on the plate between pages 198 and 199. This is online at <https://doi.org/10.11588/diglit.3439#0238>. If the illustration is to be trusted, there is another ìå∏ above ìçãìã¥. Only with a phonetic value mr for ìçã the inscription can be explained!
4. Sperveslage recently discussed in his very readable article [Three Lines on the Jar: A Note on a Term for Oil and a Reinterpretation of a Proposed Predynastic Royal Name. In: Early Egyptian Miscellanies: Discussions and Essays on Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt. 2022, pp. 199-205](https://www.ibaes.de/ibaes26/index.html) various spellings of mr·∏•.t fat. He was able to show convincingly that the spellings ìçãìàó (Sperveslage, p. 200, fig. 9: [0155](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICICUzbsj1hxR0frsfsqZWWvIcg)), ìçãìå∏ìéõ (Sperveslage, p. 203, fig. 10: [1869b](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICICU4hWG9dBGEsemCW9FN2agnU)), and ìéõìå∏ (Sperveslage, p. 203, fig. 11: [4452](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/sentence/ICABB9XBomP0V0cJhyhru2A2Is8)) are all mr·∏•.t. The spelling of ìçãìå∏ìéõ is particularly noteworthy: The ìå∏ here acts as a complement to the ìçã. A phonetic value m·∏•r for ìçã cannot explain the spellings.

### Metathesis

We have just seen that mr·∏•.t can be written with ìçã. So now is the right time to discuss an idea of Quack. He suggests that metathesis occurs in some cases for words written with ìçã. However, this is not a separate section within his article. Instead, he treats this issue in several places. He proposes the following cases:
- m·∏•r ‚Üí mr·∏• or mr·∏• ‚Üí m·∏•r
- m·∏•r ‚Üí ·∏•rm ‚Üí œÄœÖœÅŒ±ŒºŒØœÇ &ŸáŸéÿ±ŸéŸÖ

First the first case. Quack writes about the personal name ìÖ≠ìàòìéõìçã:

> Hinzu kommt die Frage, ob hier eventuell √ºber die Grenze der Bestandteile hinweg eine Lautfolge mr·∏• mit ìçã angegeben wird, was dann lediglich eine Metathese zu dem von mir angesetzten Lautwert m·∏•r w√§re. (p. 282)

In the case of the personal name ìè¥ìçãìÅê, Quack is of the opinion that it does not contain the name of the god Nj.t, but ·∏§mws.t. He writes:

> Damit er√∂ffnet sich aber erneut die Option, da√ü √ºber die Grenzen der Einzelbestandteile hinweg die Lautfolge mr·∏• mit ìçã ausgedr√ºckt wurde. (p. 283)

It should be noted that the writing of a grapheme across word boundaries postulated by Quack is not attested in the inscriptions of the Early Dynastic Period. Thus, these two cases are by no means a reliable source for metathesis. Finally, in footnote 83 on page 283, he states:

> Prinzipiell ist es auch denkbar, da√ü mr·∏• urspr√ºnglicher ist und m·∏•r die Metathese davon darstellt.

Assuming an original phonetic value mr·∏•, one could well explain the spellings of the word mr·∏•.t compiled by Sperveslage. In ìçãìå∏ìéõ, ìå∏ is the complement of ìçã, regardless of whether the phonetic value of ìçã is mr·∏• or mr. Also the title ìçãìã¥ìå∏ìå° does not contradict a reading mr·∏•, here too ìå∏ would be a complement of ìçã. However, the mentioned spellings of the personal name Mr-n·πØr with ìçã and the spellings of the kings Narmer and Semerkhet with ìå∏ cannot be explained.

In general, however, the idea of metathesis does not seem to be fully thought through and is fraught with serious problems. For example, if we assume that originally the phonetic value was mr·∏•, that is, that the evidence for ìçã from the Early Dynastic Period is to be read as mr·∏•, we must postulate that originally the title was smr·∏• and the verb "to be ill" was mr·∏•, for both words are attested in the inscriptions of the Early Dynastic Period. However, both words continue to be spelled ìçã, so metathesis must have occurred at a similar time for both words. Otherwise, one would expect spellings that indicate the process of metathesis. There are many examples in Egyptian inscriptions where an earlier and a current state are represented at the same time. For example, when the sound r is lost, a mixed spelling ìÇãìáã is offered for the verb zwr "to drink". There are also spellings of p·∫ñr that have a ìàôìÑ°. Finally, there are hybrid spellings for verbs ultimae Íú£: ìäÉìå≥ìÑøìÖììå™ìÇ°. None of this happens for words written with ìçã. There is no graphical reflex for the metathesis mr·∏• ‚Üí m·∏•r. Furthermore, metathesis certainly depends on parameters such as vocalization and syllable structure. If the vocalization or syllable structure is different, metathesis should not be effective. However, this means that the assumption of metathesis mr·∏• ‚Üí m·∏•r must assume the same vocalization and the same syllable structure of the title and the verb "to be ill". Finally, it is necessary to consider how long the process of metathesis took. Quack thinks that in the Old Kingdom the word for pyramid was m·∏•r. His supposed evidence will be rejected below. At the same time he claims:

> [...] und f√ºr die Lautform als mr·∏• gibt es auch in den Sargtexten gewisse Indizien.[fn. 84] (p. 283)

How can metathesis be completed in the Old Kingdom with the word "pyramid," but still be mr·∏• in the Middle Kingdom? It does not make any sense. The idea of metathesis is purely an ad hoc explanation that does not stand up to scrutiny.

Finally, the second metathesis proposed by Quack: He posits this in order to derive the Greek and Arabic word for pyramid from an Egyptian ·∏•rm. However, the etymological circumstances of these words are not entirely clear, so that the assumption of metathesis is quite speculative. In fact, neither the Greek nor the Arabic word is certain of an Egyptian origin.

### Conclusion

In summary, the following results: the evidence of the Early Dynastic Period is unambiguous, ìçã has the phonetic value mr. The refutations that Quack attempts have all failed and rather reveal a certain ignorance of the matter of the Early Dynastic inscriptions. My colleague Peter Pathappan has collected several cases from the Old and Middle Kingdom that also argue for the reading mr. He will publish this soon.

## Quack's supposed evidence from the Old and Middle Kingdom

On pages 275-281, Quack lists many cases that he believes support the phonetic value m·∏•r: some from the Old Kingdom, one from the Middle Kingdom, and quite a few from after the New Kingdom. Here I will consider these cases chronologically, easily refuting those from the Old and Middle Kingdom and explaining those from the New Kingdom onward.

### Urk. I, 275.2-3

The main Old Kingdom witness to the supposed phonetic value m·∏•r is an inscription from the mortuary temple of Menkaure published by [Reisner, Mycerinus. 1931](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/78801), pl. A, #3: <https://gizamedia.rc.fas.harvard.edu/images/MFA-images/Giza/GizaImage/full/library/reisner_gn_books/mycerinus/reisner_mycerinus.pdf#page=305>.

![Reisner, Mycerinus, pl. A, no. 3](/img/blog/reisner_mycerinus_pl_A_no_3.jpg "Reisner, Mycerinus, pl. A, no. 3")

Here we have a split column. The elements of both columns are thus parallel and jointly dependent on the genitive n.w. [Edel, Alt√§gyptische Grammatik. 1955/1964](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/21924), ¬ß 755 reads the first split column in the following context:

> ìÇùìÑèìÉÄìÖ±ìèõìàñìÖ±ìÖììÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥ìé° Íú•bw njw m ·∏•rk "Reinigung(szeremonie) in deiner Pyramide"

The ìé° is not in the first split column, but in the second. However, all scholars (Sethe in Urk. I, 275.2-3; [Edel](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/21924); [Goedicke](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/43371); [Collombert](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/63833); [Bogdanov](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/119647)) assume that the =k refers to both elements of the split column. The only epigraphic justification for this assumption is the size of the sign ìé° projecting into the first split column. However, it remains questionable whether this justification is sufficient to include the =k in the first split column.

[Goedicke, K√∂nigliche Dokumente aus dem Alten Reich. 1967](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/43371), p. 78 translates as follows:

> um den Kult[fn. 3] in deiner Grabanlage[fn. 4] und deines Heiligtums zu machen[fn. 5].

In note 5, Goedicke writes:

> ìàñìÖ±ìÖì ist befremdlich

This - at first sight - inexplicable ìÖì tempts [Collombert, ìçãìÖììÇãìâ¥ = ìÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥ = ìÖììÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥ = (m)·∏•r, "pyramid" ? In: GM 227, 2010, pp. 17-22](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/63833) to postulate an m·∏•r. He translates the passage as follows:

> faire les purifications de ta pyramide et de ton temple (p. 18)

Here, the ìÖì is supposed to represent the beginning of the noun m·∏•r. Edel had a different idea of how this ìÖì should be understood. He quotes this passage in his paragraph ¬ß 755, where he explains that prepositional expressions can be used like nouns by appearing in the indirect genitive. Collombert comments on this explanation as follows:

> E. Edel[fn. 6] essaie de contourner la difficult√© de la sequence n.w (g√©nitif indirect pluriel) + m (pr√©position) en supposant une substantivation de la pr√©position, similaire √† la construction du type jmÍú£·∏´w.t n(.t) ·∏´r ·∏•w.t-·∏•r, "pensionn√©e aupr√®s d'Hathor". Cette derni√®re construction est bien attest√©e mais constitue cependant un cas tr√®s particulier ; la preposition ·∏´r y est probablement employ√©e comme une sorte d'√©lement amortisseur, introduisant une marque de d√©f√©rence devant la mention d'un personnage important (ici une d√©esse, mais parfois aussi le roi, comme dans la formule ·∏•sw.t n.t ·∏´r-nsw) et s'est probablement fig√©e dans cet emploi. De fait, E. Edel ne peut citer aucun exemple parall√®le √† la construction * n m ·∏•r qu'il propose. (pp. 18-19)

Collombert thus criticizes the idea that there can be an expression genitive + prepositional expression. He considers the well-attested construction with the preposition ·∏´r to be ossified. Since he lacks parallels, he is not convinced that there is an expression with genitive + preposition m. Consequently, because of this rejection, Collombert must combine the ìÖì with the following hieroglyphs into one word.

[Bogdanov, The Old Kingdom Evidence on the Toponym ·∏´ntj-≈° "Lebanon". In: √Ñgypten und Levante 29, 2019, pp. 125-148](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/119647) does not follow Collombert. He writes:

> Nevertheless, the examples he gave are insufficient to postulate the hypothetical compound m·∏•r "pyramid". The first example he gave from the Sixth Dynasty decree Giza II[fn. 59] can be explained by layering of the prepositions nw /m in the documentary form:[fn. 60] (p. 131)

He considers the co-occurrence of the genitive and the ìÖì to be a mere error. He writes:

> Similar examples of errors in the documentary form can be found in the Dahshur decree, 13, 14:[fn. 61] ... ìÖììâóìâêìàñìèèìÖììäñìèèìâ¥ìâ¥ìä™ìèèìàñ ... m ·∏•wt n(j)t {m} njwtj (j)ptn(j) "... in the temple {in} of these two pyramid towns"; however, the phrase is possible to read ·∏•wt nt(jt) m... "temple which is in..." ... ìêçìèèìÜëìéóìÖ±ìèèìàñìéóìÖ±ìèõìÑãìä™ìèèìèõìàñìÖììäñìèèìâ¥ìâ¥ìä™ìèèìàñ ... ·∏´ftj w·∏èt n w·∏è wpt n {m} njwtj (j)ptn(j) "... in accordance with a decree of assignment ordered for {in} these two pyramid towns."

The layout of the Dahshur decree proves that the ìÖììäñìèèìâ¥ìâ¥ìä™ìèèìàñ is to be read for several columns. Bogdanov thus knows of other cases where the indirect genitive is followed by the preposition ìÖì. However, he considers this to be an error. Instead, there are other examples of the construction here, which Edel explains in ¬ß 755. Thus the ìàñìÖ±ìÖììÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥ìé° that Edel cites is no longer singular. So there is no longer any reason to consider the ìÖì after an indirect genitive as the first sign of a noun! De facto, the supposed main witness is not a main witness at all. In any case, there is no sound evidence here that one should read the sign ìçã m·∏•r.

### MFA 31.248 + 31.249

The second evidence Collombert lists is also untenable. He understands a [...] ìÅπìèèìã¥ìÖììÖììÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥ìâªìàñ [...] as:

> "... la faire dans la pyramide principale pour ..." (... jr.t=s m m·∏•r Íú•Íú£ n ...) (p. 20)

The textual context is very fragmentary, but nevertheless the suffix =s seems very unlikely. What, after all, should it refer to? Accordingly, the interpretation of [Brovarski, Once More ·∏•r, 'Pyramid'? In: Sitting Beside Lepsius. Studies in Honour of Jaromir Malek at the Griffith Institute. 2009, pp. 98-114](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/63807) is preferable. He reads:

> ... what the sem-priest did on[fn. g] the principal pyramid[fn. h] for ... (p. 105)

This corresponds to a jr.t sm m ·∏•r Íú•Íú£ n ... This eliminates all the approaches Collombert offers to postulate a m·∏•r in the Old Kingdom.

### JE 52001 C

Quack sees a passage from the papyrus Cairo JE 52001 C, namely [oraec1844-6](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec1844-6.html) as further support for the phonetic value m·∏•r: dm·∏è n kÍú£.t ìàñìèèìÖììÅ∑ìÇãìâ¥  Íú•Íú£. Posener-Kri√©ger translates in her editio princeps ([Fragments de Papyrus Provenant de Saqqarah. In: Rd√â 32, 1980, pp. 83-93](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/7077)): "Total de travaux qui ont lieu √† la pyramide principale" Brovarski, p. 104, follows this interpretation and transcribes: dmd n kÍú£t nty m ·∏•r Íú•Íú£. Hafemann [translates](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec1844-6.html) similarly: "Die Gesamtheit der Arbeit, die im gro√üen Pyramidenplateau (zu machen)ist:" She offers furthermore the following [comment](https://aaew.bbaw.de/tla/servlet/S02?wc=684184&db=0) for the ìàñìèè in the old TLA:

> Bezugswort dmD

Quack questions the unanimous interpretation as a relative pronoun and ponders:

> ob man dies als kÍú£.t n.t m·∏•r oder als kÍú£.t n.tÍûΩ m ·∏•r segmentiert. Die Tatsache, da√ü in der vorangehenden Spalte in der √úberschrift eindeutig kÍú£.t n.t sÍú£·∏´ ÍûΩnb steht, also mit indirektem Genitiv, nicht mit Relativsatz konstruiert wird, stellt ein schwerwiegendes Argument zugunsten der ersten L√∂sung dar. (p. 275)

Quack thus presents two options: kÍú£.t n.t m·∏•r and kÍú£.t n.tj m ·∏•r. The second variant, however, is grammatically incorrect. The relative pronoun would have to be feminine, since it follows the genus of the reference word. However, this problem is solved by looking at the whole phrase. This is because kÍú£.t is included in the phrase dm·∏è n kÍú£.t . So the relative pronoun can refer to the masculine dm·∏è, as Hafemann notes. Why does Quack abbreviate here, suppressing the grammatical impossibility of his second option? This looks a bit like sleight of hand. For if he omits the dm·∏è, he can more easily postulate a parallelism to another passage with kÍú£.t. But the conclusion that kÍú£.t must follow with indirect genitive because kÍú£.t is so used in another passage is also based on a purely superficial consideration and cannot be sustained. In fact, the construction of kÍú£.t clearly depends on the nature of the dependent phrase. This becomes clear when one looks at the constructions with kÍú£.t in the titles of the Old Kingdom. The patron of the kÍú£.t, that is, the one who benefits from the kÍú£.t, is attached with the genitive. [jm.j-r æ-kÍú£.t-n.t-nzw](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/850610.html) "overseer of the king's works," [jm.j-r æ-kÍú£.t-nb.t-n.t-nswt](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/401164.html) "overseer of all works of the king." Similarly, the type of activity is constructed with the genitive. [m·∏•nk-nzw-m-kÍú£.t-jr.w-Íú•n.t](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/450422.html) "intimate of the king in the works of manicuring/care of hands and nails," m·∏•nk-nzw-m-kÍú£.t-jr.w-≈°n "intimate of the king in the works of hairdressing." The places, on the other hand, where the kÍú£.t is performed are connected with the preposition m: jm.j-r æ-kÍú£.t-m-·∏•w. t-n·πØr "overseer of works in the temple," jm.j-r æ-kÍú£.t-m-spÍú£.wt-·∏•r.jwt-jb-≈†mÍú•.w "overseer of works in the Middle Nomes of Upper Egypt." This tendency is evident, although there are isolated outliers, cf. [Jones](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/17063), #952. Thus, when a kÍú£.t at the pyramid is reported, it is to be expected that the word for pyramid is connected with the preposition. However, in what Quack considers a parallel phrase, the kÍú£.t is followed by an infinitive describing an activity - however it is to be understood here exactly. This means: the supposed parallelism does not exist at all. Instead of postulating a m·∏•r one should better read here preposition m with the following noun!

Quack also quotes another ìÖììÅ∑ìâ¥ìÜë. However, Quack considers the context to be too incomplete. In fact, one could also simply recognize the preposition m-·∏•r here with a following logogram.

### Word play

Finally, Quack quotes the sentence [oraec861-17](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec861-17.html) from the Pyramid Texts (PT 600): m ·∏•riÃØ jr =f m rn =f n(,j) ìçãìÖììÇãìâ¥. He sees this as a confirmation of the phonetic value m·∏•r; for the play on words (m ·∏•riÃØ on one side and ìçãìÖììÇãìâ¥ on the other) is only possible if the pyramid is to be read m·∏•r. Schweitzer, in his article mentioned above, had discussed the different types of sources that can help to find out the phonetic values of signs. He categorically rejects word plays:

> Augenscheinlich kann man mit Wortspielen jede gew√ºnschte Lesung best√§tigen. F√ºr eine Bestimmung des Lautwertes ist es damit ungeeignet und sollte nicht herangezogen werden. (S. 133)

Quack takes up this criticism and distinguishes two kinds of word plays. One type he calls "explicit" because the Egyptians themselves indicated that a word play was present. The other type of word plays are those that are discovered by modern scholars without being indicated by the ancient scribe. Quack now considers only the explicit word plays as reliable witnesses for determining a phonetic value. He quotes on page 277 a possible, but not explicit word play, which he does not want to accept as evidence. He writes about the explicit word play:

> Wo dagegen die √Ñgypter selbst uns explizit angeben, da√ü ein Wortspiel vorliegt, d.h. insbesondere in der sogenannten Namensformel,[fn. 18] liegt die Sache anders; hier ist grunds√§tzlich von einer Lautkorrelation auszugehen,[fn. 19] und entsprechend haben solche Stellen im Zweifelsfall auch argumentatives Gewicht. (p. 274)

Let's take a closer look at the name formula, to which the above mentioned theorem m ·∏•riÃØ jr =f m rn =f n(,j) ìçãìÖììÇãìâ¥ belongs. The most important work on the name formula is [Hellum, In Your Name of Sarcophagus: The 'Name Formula' in the Pyramid Texts. In: JARCE 51, 2015, pp. 235-242](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/105457). Quack, surprisingly, does not cite this article. Hellum discusses this formula at length, and in particular the word play in these phrases. She writes on page 239:

> Paronomasia is an essential part of the name formula: every example of the formula in the Pyramid Texts shows some evidence of word play. It occurs invariably between the verb and the name, and the word play lies in the spelling of the word, rather than in its meaning. In the following example, the evidence of word play is obvious in the original:<br />
·πØ·∏•n·∏•n=k jm=s m-m n·πØrw m rn=s pw n ·πØ·∏•nt<br />
You should gleam by means of it among the gods, in this its name ƒ±Õóf "Faience." (PT 301 ¬ß 454)<br />
The verb ·πØ·∏•n·∏•n "to gleam"[fn. 27] contains the same consonants, bar only the feminine t, to ·πØ·∏•nt "faience."[fn. 28] It is more common than not that, as here, the verb and the name[fn. 29] share a cluster of consonants, most, but rarely all, of which are identical.

The "Lautkorrelation" that Quack is talking about is confirmed by Hellum. But with Hellum you have to assume that not all consonants are identical. A very nice example Hellum gives on page 237 is [oraec1238-11](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec1238-11.html) from PT 366: ... jmiÃØ =k ·∏ènd m rn =k n(,j) ·∏èndr,w, "... damit Du nicht zornig bist in Deinem Namen 'Barke'". Here the wordplay exists between the verb ·∏ènd and the name ·∏èndr.w. Some, but not all, of the consonants are identical. If in these examples the word play does not involve all consonants, then in m ·∏•riÃØ jr =f m rn =f n(,j) ìçãìÖììÇãìâ¥ there could also be a word play involving only some consonants.

Quack, however, claims:

> Wie oben ausgef√ºhrt, m√ºssen derartige explizite Wortspiele mit der Namensformel m rn=f m ... ernst genommen werden und z√§hlen als Argumente f√ºr die Ansetzung der Lautform - sofern Schweitzer keine Belege daf√ºr geben kann, da√ü anderswo ein ·∏• in einer Namensformel ohne Korrespondenz im ausgedeuteten Wort ist, mu√ü der Beleg als definitive Absicherung der Lesung gelten. (p. 275)

I hope to prove that Quack is wrong here as well. The first proof is the example of Hellum. There is a word play between ·πØ·∏•n·∏•n and ·πØ·∏•n.t. The second ·∏• is missing in ·πØ·∏•n.t. There are other cases where there is not complete agreement regarding ·∏•:

The examples of the name formula, and especially these cases, show that one cannot make any predictions about the form in the name formula. By this I mean the following: If only the beginning of the formula is preserved, one cannot reconstruct what the end is. Accordingly, one cannot predict the exact phonetic form of the elements in the word play. For the reconstruction of the phonetic values, the examples from the name formula are completely worthless.

### CT V, 133b

For the Middle Kingdom, Quack cites only one piece of evidence. He writes:

> Bemerkenswert ist auch die Schreibung ìéõìÖììÇãìèèìÖ™ìàôìè§ìàáìè• CT V 113 b, in welcher das Determinativ des schlechten Vogels nahelegt, da√ü der Schreiber eine Verbindung zum Wort "krank sein" gezogen hat.

CT V, 133b, however, does not offer a consistent textual tradition. Only [T1C](http://database.mortexvar.com/spell/397) has the spelling quoted by Quack. T1Be has ìå∏ìÇãìéõìèèìè≠ìàôìàáìè§ìÖ±ìè≠, while M2C and Sq2C are quite different. To what extent a reference can really be made to a word written with ìçã is highly speculative. In other words, this passage from the coffin texts is completely worthless as an argument.

### Conclusion

Thus, there is no positive evidence for a phonetic value m·∏•r in either the Old or Middle Kingdom!

## The state of affairs after the New Kingdom

For the post-New Kingdom period, however, Quack offers a variety of evidence using a single consonant sign for ·∏•. How can this be reconciled with the clear evidence for the phonetic value mr? The first possibility is phonetic development. This assumes that the words originally read mr or smr are now m·∏•r or sm·∏•r. This is more than unlikely. First, a development "√∏ ‚Üí ·∏•" is not otherwise attested in Egyptian, and second, this development would occur only in words written with ìçã, not in those written with ìå∏. Consequently, in his article on the phonetic value of ìçã (p. 143), Schweitzer rejects the idea of a phonetic development from mr to m·∏•r.

Instead, Schweitzer wants to understand the spellings with a written ·∏• as scribal errors. There are two interesting questions here: First, is it plausible that a sign with the phonetic value ·∏• could ever have evolved from ìçã? Schweitzer mentions various misspellings which show that in general there is a possibility that ìçã can be written into ìéõ. Second, why do the spellings with the single consonant ·∏• exist even if the text is not based on a *Vorlage*? And why is ·∏• written quasi-regularly? Schweitzer writes:

> Dass diese Verschreibungen nicht korrigiert wurden, lag m. E. auch daran, dass die mit ìçã [U23] geschriebenen W√∂rter aus der Alltagssprache verschwunden waren bzw. dass sie durch andere W√∂rter verdr√§ngt wurden[fn. 173] und somit der genaue Lautwert nicht immer pr√§sent war. (p. 144)

According to Quack, this motivation is not tenable. He writes:

> Schweitzers Behauptung, hier seien Fehler nicht korrigiert worden, weil das Wort nicht mehr der gesprochenen Sprache angeh√∂re und somit der genaue Lautwert nicht immer pr√§sent war,[fn. 49] trifft in dieser Form sicher nicht zu. Das Wort m·∏•r "krank sein" ist zwar im Koptischen nicht mehr gebr√§uchlich, im Demotischen jedoch definitiv noch ausreichend gut belegt.[fn. 50] (pp. 278-279)

In note 50, Quack then lists evidence for the verb mr "to be ill" in Demotic. However, most of this evidence comes from literary texts. So here again we have the impure argumentation. What Schweitzer calls "everyday language" is certainly not congruent with what Quack calls "spoken language". Once again, a straw man is set up! Nevertheless, one will tend to agree with Quack that the motivation Schweitzer proposes is questionable. Why should one use words in the textual production of demotic literary texts that one no longer knows and therefore misspells?

But how can one reconcile the phonetic value mr, which can be clearly proven in the inscriptions of the Early Dynastic Period, with the spellings with ·∏• in the first millennium? Dear all, let me now take you into the world of toponyms. [Al-Ayedi, Ancient Egyptian Geographic Dictionary. 2012](https://worldcat.org/de/title/839975889), lists the following independent entry on page 775: Ssnw. He offers as spellings ìã¥ìã¥ìàñìèåìÖ±ìäñ or ìäÉìäÉìèåìäñ, among others. According to Al-Ayedi, it is the modern el-Ashmunin. The modern place name goes back to the Egyptian ·∏™mn.w, cf. [Peust, Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen √Ñgypten. 2010](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/63876), p. 13. The name of the city was exactly the same as the Egyptian word for "eight". Therefore, ·∏™mn.w is also written with the digit for eight. [Montet, Geographie de l'√âgypte ancienne. Deuxi√®me partie. 1961](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/26186), p. 146, notes the following about the spellings of this city

> Tardivement apparaissent les orthographes [...] ìã¥ìã¥ìàñìèåìÖ±ìäñ dont la lecture est identique.

[Gauthier, Dictionnaire des noms g√©ographiques contenus dans les textes hi√©roglyphiques](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/77795). Tome quatri√®me. 1927, p. 176, writes:

> On rencontre aussi aux basses √©poques une s√©rie d'orthographes toutes diff√©rentes ìã¥ìã¥ìàñìèåìÖ±ìäñ, [...], qui ne paraissent pas avoir √©t√© lues Sinou, mais bien Khmounou comme les autres [...].

The spellings from more recent times are explained by the hieratic. There the sign for the eight resembles a ìã¥ìã¥, cf. [Jansen-Winkeln, Sp√§tmittel√§gyptische Grammatik der Texte der 3. Zwischenzeit. 1996](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/12772), ¬ß 42. However, not all spellings can be understood as direct misinterpretations of the hieratic. A ìäÉìäÉìèåìäñ still needs the intermediate step that a ìã¥ can become a ìäÉ, because both signs have the same phonetic value s.

To summarize: Similarities in hieratic writing in the first millennium can lead to the reinterpretation of established spellings, and that these reinterpretations can in turn be the basis for further variations (in our example, ìã¥ becomes ìäÉ). [Hoffmann, Die Verwendung Hieratischer Zeichen in Demotischen Medizinischen Texten. In: Aspects of Demotic Orthography. 2013](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/99246), pp. 38-39, lists many more examples:

- The well-known word wnm "to eat" is written in the Old Kingdom with the two signs ìèòìèò, which were later understood as q. This developed in the New Kingdom into an independent word qq, which appears in Demotic as kk and in Coptic as œ≠‚≤±œ≠, cf. [Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexicon. 1997](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/14470), p. 1069; [Peust, Das Napatanische. 1999](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/17006), p. 182.
- The word ·∏´m "sanctuary" can be written ìêçìãâìÖììâê. The ìãâ is interpreted over time as ìäÉ. Wilson, A Ptolemaic Lexicon. 1997, p. 904 cites instances of alliteration with s. In this respect, then, an independent word z·∏´m has developed. The reinterpretation of ìãâ ‚Üí ìäÉ also affects the name of the city of Letopolis. The original ·∏™m was later understood as S·∏´m, as evidenced by the Greek rendering ·ºàœÅŒΩŒµŒ≤ŒµœÉœá·øÜŒΩŒπœÇ of the demotic phrase ·∏§r nb ShÃ≠m, cf. [CDD s, p. 376](https://isac.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/shared/docs/CDD_S.pdf).
- wÍú£siÃØ, which can be written ìåÅìÖ±ìÖ™, mixes with ·∏èÍú•m (ìåÅìÖììÖ™) to form a wsm that appears in demotic texts, cf. [Hoffmann, Der Kampf um den Panzer des Inaros: Studien zum P. Krall und seiner Stellung innerhalb des Inaros-Petubastis-Zyklus. 1996](https://aegyptiaca.uni-muenster.de/Record/14961), pp. 206-207, fn. 1054.
- In Demotic, the word for "wife" is originally ·∏•bsy.t, but later it is ·∏•m.t.
- The word zÍú£ "son" is understood in filiations as pa "the of."

Here, too, traditional spellings are reinterpreted. This even goes so far that, first, the new spellings find their way into the spoken language as new words and that, second, the reinterpretations caused by the hieratic script are partly also to be found in the demotic script. It would be too short-sighted to classify these new spellings exclusively as spelling mistakes. Rather, they testify to a productive handling of the millennia-old writing tradition. Here also lies the solution in the dilemma that ìçã certainly has the phonetic value mr, but nevertheless spellings with the single consonant sign ·∏• are attested in the first millennium. As Schweitzer, p. 144 has shown, there is confusion of ìçã with other tall hieroglyphs. Then it is not unlikely that the ìçã - like the ìèò or the ìãâ - was also subjected to reinterpretation. Interpretations internal to the script may have produced a new word with ·∏•. Thus, it is not an "either mr or m·∏•r" but a temporal ordering. Classically one has to read mr, while in the first millennium it can also be m·∏•r. One has to interpret the ìçã according to the dating of the source. But this also means that one must accept the independence of the interpretations of the respective periods. It is not adequate to the sources if someone like Schweitzer wants to interpret the late evidence as errors. But it is also a failed endeavor when a researcher like Quack wants to invalidate the valid evidence from the Early Dynastic Period just because he knows evidence from the epoch he is familiar with that seemingly contradicts the findings from the Early Dynastic Period (an epoch in which - as can be clearly seen - he is not so familiar). We must not pit one epoch of Egyptian culture against another. Just as demotists do not like it when their field is not considered full-fledged Egyptology, so Early Dynastic Period researchers do not like it when colleagues like Quack do not take the material of this period seriously and want to explain away regular findings just because the later period sees it that way.

## tl;dr

The phonetic value of ìçã is mr, not m·∏•r, as the evidence from the Early Dynastic Period clearly proves. Quack's attempts to refute the evidence have all failed. Late spellings with single consonant signs for ·∏• show that ìçã was reinterpreted in later times.
