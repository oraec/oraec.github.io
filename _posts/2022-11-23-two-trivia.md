# Two trivia

Our last blogposts were very long. Now we don't have the energy to write much at all. Sorry, folks! So here are just two very short news:

## \#1

ORAEC has so far text names which are not very meaningful. Here as an example [oraec80](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec80.html): ![previous information about oraec80](/img/blog/oraec80_without_path.jpg "previous information about oraec80")

With this information nobody can guess which text is present. This is total crap! Completely user unfriendly! Sorry, we messed that up! As promised in a [previous blog](https://oraec.github.io/2022/10/30/next-steps.html), we created a hierarchical path for each text from the [partial extract](https://nbn-resolving.org/urn:nbn:de:kobv:b4-opus4-29190) on which the ORAEC data is based. Check out what oraec80 looks like now: ![improved presentation of oraec80](/img/blog/oraec80_with_path.jpg "improved presentation of oraec80")

This does give a better understanding of which text is oraec80. The hierarchical levels are links in the [new TLA](https://thesaurus-linguae-aegyptiae.de/), so you can get additional information there. (Remember, the new TLA provides metadata for both texts and objects, while ORAEC focuses on the texts.)

## \#2

Second, we have created a [list of all lemmata](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/all_lemmata_in_ORAEC.html) that are used in ORAEC. We don't have a search interface, but maybe this is a nice help to find words in ORAEC.

So we now have the following overview pages:

* [list of all texts](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/oraec_text_list.html)

* [list of all lemmata](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/all_lemmata_in_ORAEC.html)

* [list of all grammatical features](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/all_features.html)

* [list of all hieroglyphic writings](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/all_writings.html)

* [list of ORAEC's controlled vocabulary](https://oraec.github.io/corpus/controlled_vocab.html)

Have fun!
